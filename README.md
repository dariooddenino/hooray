# HOORAY!

A Zig port of the "Ray tracing in one weekend" series.

Built using mach-core and zig-gamedev libraries.

Current shaders are taken from https://github.com/Shridhar2602/WebGPU-Path-Tracer

## TODO

### Pointers
I think I should simplify things and avoid pointers as much as possible.

### Fix bvh
The program crashes during `flatten`.
I'm not sure why, I should have been more careful with my code.

### Camera
- The moveCamera function will have to be designed in a completely different way.

### Random notes

## Done

The basic structure is down.
There are a few things that I still have to understand, and then there's the 
big problem of serializing my structures correctly for the fragments.
